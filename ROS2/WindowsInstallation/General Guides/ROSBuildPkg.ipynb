        "You can actually build multiple packages at a time by running the `colcon build` command in your workspace directory. If you want to build each package individually, separate them into different directories, and build each one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "For our purposes, place all of the packages you want to build within the same workspace, usually `src`. If you are following our guide from before, it should be in your `ros2_ws` directory, so on Linux, navigate to it via `cd ~/ros2_ws`, and on Windows, navigate to it via `cd \\ros2_ws`\n",
        "\n",
        "To actually build your packages in Linux, run the command:\n",

        "```\n",

        "ros2 run my_package my_node\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "And then the executeable in your ROS2 package should run without any issues."
