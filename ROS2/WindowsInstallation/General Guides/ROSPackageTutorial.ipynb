        "By this point in your ROS journey, you should have set up your ROS2 installation, properly installed and used Colcon, and be able to set up your ROS environment by calling `setup.bash`\n",

        "If you have reached this point, you can now develop ROS Packages in both C++ and Python, this guide will go over both.\n",

        "To begin creating any ROS2 Package, use the following command:\n",
        "```\n",

        "```\n",

        "After reaching your workspace, enter the following command to create the package:\n",

        "ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake --license Apache-2.0 --node-name my_node my_package\n",
        "```\n",
