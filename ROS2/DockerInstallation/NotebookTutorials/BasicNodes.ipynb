    "# Basic ROS Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "You are already familiar with ROS nodes from the Turtlesim exercises. Nodes are simply modular programs that can act on data, and pass information between each other. See the diagram on the [Offical ROS2 Docs](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Understanding-ROS2-Nodes/Understanding-ROS2-Nodes.html) for a visual animation of information being passed between nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Turtlesim exercise, you worked with two nodes: the turtlesim itself, and the teleop keyboard controller. In that system, the Turtlesim keeps track of all the turtles, and moves them according to data it recieves from the keyboard controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "![TurtleNode.png](images/TurtleNode.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, `teleop_turtle` (the keyboard node) sends data to `turtlesim` about the speed that it wants turtle1 to move at (`turtle1/cmd_vel`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, `turtlesim` sends data back about the status of `rotate_absolute` actions. Try it out now! Launch the turtlesim and turtle_teleop_key nodes, and monitor info passed between them with `ros2 topic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel`."
