    "\n",
    "If you are using Windows, you must also install WSL2 or HyperV. For this tutorial, we use and recommend WSL2. When prompted by the Docker Desktop installer in step 1, prefer WSL2 over HyperV.\n",
    "\n",
    "WSL2 can be installed by running: `wsl --install`\n",
    "in an administrator terminal. An administrator terminal can be accessed by searching for \"Terminal\" in the Windows search bar, right clicking on the icon, and then selecting \"Run as administrator\".\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Mac does not have a built in GUI server, so we need to install one. [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) is the server we recommend.\n",

    "2. Under the XQuartz menu, navigate to Preferences > Security and ensure \"Allow connections from network clients\" is checked.\n",

You can install VSCode extensions using the Extensions tab in the sidebar (the four squares)\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- TODO VSCODE terminal gif -->\n",
    "\n",
