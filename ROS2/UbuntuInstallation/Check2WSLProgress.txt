As of now, Turtle Checkpoint 2 is not fully operational for WSL2. 
The biggest roadblock to the end of that checkpoint is that WSL2 does not want to open any camera, 
even one successfully bound and shared with the Linux subsystem. 
Future work needs to uncover whether this is a WSL2 issue or an OpenCV issue.

To progress to where the issue occurs, complete the following steps:
1. Source ROS2 from the local /opt/.../setup.bash
2. Ensure the packages are built with colcon build
3. Source ROS2 from the install folder in the Middleware directory .../install/setup.bash
4. Install USBPID for Windows using this information: https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/wiki/WSL-support
5. In an Admistrative Command Prompt, run the command usbipd list. This should show all information for all connected
USB devices. Identify the camera you'd like to use.
6. Run the command usbipd bind --busid CAMERA_BUSID. This binds the camera's usage to the software.
7. Run the command usbipd attach --wsl --busid CAMERA_BUSID. This should share the bound camera to WSL.
8. Returning to your Linux Terminal, enter the command lsusb. You should see the shared camera in the list
9. Try to run the command ros2 run webcam webcam_pub in the Middleware's src directory. This is where the failure occurs.
